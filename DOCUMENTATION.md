## 1. Project Overview

FlowDash is a web-based inventory management system designed for small to medium-sized factories. It provides a user-friendly interface for floor staff to log their work and for factory admins to oversee operations, manage products, and view reports.

### 1.1. Features

*   **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login with session and persistent login options.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Differentiated permissions for `factory_admin` (full access) and `floor_staff` (limited to their own logs).
*   **Product Management:** Admins can create, view, update, and manage products, including attributes and images.
*   **Bulk Operations:** Admins can import products via CSV and upload multiple images at once.
*   **Inventory Logging:** Floor staff can log the quantity of products they have produced.
*   **Dashboard & Reporting:** Admins can view production summaries and generate reports.
*   **Multi-language Support:** The UI supports English, Hindi, and Gujarati.
*   **Error Monitoring:** Integrated with Sentry for real-time error tracking.
*   **Structured Logging:** Uses Pino for structured, detailed application logs.

### 1.2. Tech Stack

## 2. Architecture

The application follows a modern monolithic architecture using Next.js, where the frontend and backend are part of the same project.

### 2.1. Frontend

The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, using the Chakra UI component library for a consistent and accessible design system. State management is handled through a combination of React Context (`AuthContext`, `LanguageContext`, `LoadingContext`) and component-level state.

### 2.2. Backend

The backend is built using Next.js API Routes. These are serverless functions that handle all business logic, from database interactions to authentication.

### 2.3. Database

The application uses a Vercel Postgres database. Database queries are executed using the `@vercel/postgres` library, which provides a simple interface for interacting with the database. Database migrations are managed manually via SQL scripts located in `src/lib/migrations`.

### 2.4. Authentication

The authentication system is based on JSON Web Tokens (JWT). It supports both session-only and persistent ("Keep me signed in") logins.

#### How it Works:

1.  **Login Request:** The user enters their credentials on the login page. A `rememberMe` boolean flag is sent along with the username and password to the `POST /api/auth/login` endpoint.
2.  **Token Generation:** The backend validates the credentials. If they are correct, it generates a JWT using the `jose` library. The token's expiration is set conditionally:
    *   If `rememberMe` is `true`, the token expires in **30 days**.
    *   If `rememberMe` is `false`, the token expires in **1 day**.
3.  **Token Storage:** The generated token is sent back to the client. The `AuthContext` on the frontend is responsible for storing this token:
    *   If `rememberMe` is `true`, the token is stored in **`localStorage`**. This persists the token even after the browser is closed.
    *   If `rememberMe` is `false`, the token is stored in **`sessionStorage`**. This token is cleared when the browser session ends (i.e., the tab or window is closed).
4.  **Authenticated Requests:** An Axios request interceptor (`src/lib/api.js`) is configured to run before every API call. It reads the token from either `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` and adds it to the `Authorization` header of the request:
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
    ```
5.  **Token Verification:** A backend middleware (`src/lib/auth.ts`) protects all secure API routes. It extracts the token from the `Authorization` header, verifies its signature and expiration using the `JWT_SECRET`, and attaches the user's payload to the request object for use in the API route handlers.
6.  **Logout:** When the user logs out, the `AuthContext` explicitly removes the token from both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` to ensure the session is terminated.

This approach replaces the previous `httpOnly` cookie-based method to provide more flexible, client-side control over session persistence.

## 4. Frontend Components

This section provides an overview of the main React components found in `src/components`.

### 4.1. Core Application &amp; Providers

*   **`Providers.tsx`**: A crucial component that wraps the entire application. It sets up all the necessary context providers (`ChakraProvider`, `AuthProvider`, `LanguageProvider`, `LoadingProvider`) so that they are available to all child components.
*   **`AppInitializer.tsx`**: This component is responsible for initializing the application state when it first loads. It checks for an existing user session and fetches initial data.
*   **`GlobalSpinner.tsx`**: Listens to the `LoadingContext` and displays a full-screen loading spinner whenever a global loading state is active (e.g., during page transitions or major data fetches).
*   **`WithAuth.tsx`**: A Higher-Order Component (HOC) that wraps pages or components requiring authentication. It checks if a user is logged in; if not, it redirects them to the login page.

### 4.2. Authentication &amp; User Management

*   **`Login.tsx`**: Renders the login form, handles user input, and calls the authentication API. Includes the "Keep me signed in" functionality.
*   **`Register.tsx`**: Renders the registration form for new organizations and factory admins.
*   **`UserManager.tsx`**: A full-featured component for factory admins to view, invite, edit, and deactivate users within their organization.
*   **`ProfileManager.tsx`**: Allows the currently logged-in user to update their own profile information, such as their name and password.
*   **`UserProfileForm.tsx`**: A reusable form component used by both `UserManager` and `ProfileManager` for editing user details.

### 4.3. Product &amp; Inventory Management

*   **`ProductManager.tsx`**: The main interface for admins to manage the product catalog. It includes features for viewing, searching, filtering, adding, editing, and archiving products.
*   **`ProductAttributesManager.tsx`**: A component for managing the centralized product attributes (Category, Design, Color, etc.). Found on the product settings page.
*   **`ProductSelector.tsx`**: A reusable dropdown component that allows users to search for and select a product. Used in the inventory logging flow.
*   **`InventoryLogs.tsx`**: The primary interface for `floor_staff` to log their production. It also allows admins to view all logs.
*   **`EditLogModal.tsx`**: A modal dialog that allows users to edit their existing inventory log entries.

### 4.4. Dashboards &amp; Reporting

*   **`ProductionDashboard.tsx`**: The main dashboard page that displays key performance indicators (KPIs) and summaries of production data.
*   **`WeeklyProductionChart.tsx`**: A bar chart component that visualizes the production totals for the last seven days.

## 5. Context Providers

The application uses the React Context API for global state management. The providers are set up in `src/components/Providers.tsx`.

### 5.1. `AuthContext` (`src/context/AuthContext.tsx`)

This is the most critical context, managing the application's authentication state.

*   **State:**
    *   `isAuthenticated`: A boolean indicating if a user is currently logged in.
    *   `user`: An object containing the authenticated user's details (id, name, role, etc.).
    *   `token`: The raw JWT.
*   **Functions:**
    *   `login(username, password, rememberMe)`: Handles the login process, calls the API, and stores the token.
    *   `logout()`: Clears the token from storage and resets the authentication state.
    *   `handleAuthentication(token, rememberMe)`: A core function to process a new token, store it in the correct Web Storage (`localStorage` or `sessionStorage`), and update the application state.
    *   `checkAuth()`: Checks for a token in storage on application load to maintain the session.

### 5.2. `LanguageContext` (`src/context/LanguageContext.tsx`)

Manages the application's internationalization (i18n) state.

*   **State:**
    *   `language`: The currently selected language code (e.g., 'en', 'hi', 'gu').
*   **Functions:**
    *   `changeLanguage(lang)`: Changes the application's language. It updates the `i18next` instance and persists the user's preference.

### 5.3. `LoadingContext` (`src/context/LoadingContext.tsx`)

Manages the global loading state, allowing any component to trigger the global loading spinner.

*   **State:**
    *   `isLoading`: A boolean indicating if the global spinner should be visible.
*   **Functions:**
    *   `showLoading()`: Sets `isLoading` to `true`.
    *   `hideLoading()`: Sets `isLoading` to `false`.
