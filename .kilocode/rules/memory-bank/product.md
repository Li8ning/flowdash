# FlowDash - Product Description

## ðŸŽ¯ **Why FlowDash Exists**
FlowDash is a web-based inventory management system built to address the specific needs of small to medium-sized factories, particularly in the Indian market. The primary goal is to provide a simple, user-friendly platform for factory owners and floor staff to track production, manage inventory, and gain insights into their operations.

## ðŸ§© **Problems It Solves**
- **Lack of Real-time Visibility**: Factory owners often struggle to get real-time data on production and inventory levels, leading to inefficiencies and delays.
- **Complex and Unsuitable Software**: Existing inventory management solutions are often too complex, expensive, or not tailored to the workflow of a factory floor.
- **Manual and Error-Prone Processes**: Many factories rely on manual, paper-based systems for tracking production, which are prone to errors and difficult to analyze.
- **Language and Usability Barriers**: Software is often not available in local languages or designed for users with limited technical literacy.

## ðŸš€ **How It Works**
FlowDash is a multi-tenant, web-based application with role-based access control. The key user journeys are:
- **Floor Staff**: Log in to their account, select the products they have produced during their shift, and enter the quantities. The interface is designed to be simple and mobile-friendly for use on tablets and phones.
- **Factory Admins**: Manage the day-to-day operations of the factory. They can add, edit, and delete products, manage user accounts, and view production logs. They can also bulk-import products, upload product images through the centralized Media Library, and manage all media assets.
- **Factory Owners/Managers**: Get a high-level overview of the factory's operations through a dashboard. They can view production summaries, track inventory levels, and generate reports.

## âœ¨ **User Experience Goals**
- **Simplicity and Ease of Use**: The application should be intuitive and easy to use, even for users who are not tech-savvy. The user interface should be clean, uncluttered, and focused on the core tasks of each user role.
- **Accessibility**: The application must be accessible to users with varying levels of technical skills and literacy. This includes providing a simple and straightforward user interface and comprehensive multi-language support (English, Hindi, and Gujarati) with translations specifically simplified for factory workers with limited technical literacy.
- **Mobile-First**: The application should be fully responsive and optimized for use on mobile devices, as floor staff will primarily use tablets or smartphones.
- **Reliability**: The application should be reliable and performant, even in environments with intermittent internet connectivity.
