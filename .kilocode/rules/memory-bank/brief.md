# FlowDash - Memory Bank Project Brief

## 🏭 **What We're Building**
FlowDash is a web-based inventory management system designed specifically for small to medium-sized factories. It helps factory owners manage their operations by allowing floor staff to log production data while giving admins oversight and reporting capabilities.

## 🎯 **Core Business Problem**
Factory owners need a simple way to track what their workers are producing on the floor, manage their product catalog, and get real-time visibility into their inventory levels. Current solutions are either too complex or don't fit the factory workflow.

## 👥 **Who Uses It**
- **Factory Owners/Managers** - Need oversight of production and inventory
- **Floor Staff** - Need to quickly log what they've produced during shifts
- **Factory Admins** - Manage day-to-day operations and user accounts

## 🔑 **Key Features We Need**
- **Production Logging** - Workers log quantities of products they've made
- **Product Management** - Admins can add/edit products with images and details
- **Media Library** - Centralized image management with upload, view, edit, and delete capabilities
- **User Management** - Role-based access for different types of users
- **Multi-language Support** - English, Hindi, and Gujarati for Indian factories
- **Inventory Tracking** - Real-time view of what's in stock
- **Reporting** - Production summaries and analytics for management

## 🌍 **Business Context**
- **Target Market**: Small to medium Indian factories
- **Multi-tenant**: Each factory is a separate organization with isolated data
- **Mobile-friendly**: Floor staff often use tablets or phones
- **Offline considerations**: Factories may have unreliable internet
- **Target User**: Most of the users will be uneducated, might not have worked with technology or this type of software. So the app should be very easy to access and user friendly.

## 🔒 **Security & Compliance**
- **Role-based permissions**: Different access levels for different user types
- **Data isolation**: Each organization's data must stay separate
