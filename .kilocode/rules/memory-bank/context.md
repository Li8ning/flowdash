# FlowDash - Context

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current Work Focus**
The application has completed a comprehensive button color scheme implementation to ensure proper visual feedback for different action types. The focus was on fixing theme configuration overrides that were preventing Chakra UI's colorScheme props from working correctly, ensuring destructive actions appear red, positive actions appear green, and primary actions appear blue.

## ðŸ”„ **Recent Changes**
- **Fixed Critical Race Condition**: Resolved a complex client-side race condition between Next.js App Router parameter hydration, `AuthContext` initialization, and `i18next` language loading. This fix stabilized the application on page refresh.
- **Eliminated Infinite API Loop**: By fixing the underlying i18n and authentication race condition, the infinite API call loop that was occurring on all authenticated pages has been eliminated.
- **Corrected URL Generation**: Fixed a bug where navigation links would be generated with `/undefined/...` in the URL path on page refresh. The fix ensures the language parameter (`lng`) is correctly passed from the page `params` to the layout components.
- **Stabilized Translations**: Ensured that translations load correctly and reliably on page refresh by synchronizing the `i18next` instance with the language parameter from the URL.
- **Centralized Loading State**: Refactored the initial application loading logic into the `AppInitializer` component to prevent multiple components from managing competing loading states, which was the original source of the "white blank screen" bug.
- **Added Loading Feedback**: Implemented loading state feedback on the login and logout buttons for a better user experience.
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed all debugging `console.log` statements from the codebase.
- **Linting**: Fixed all linting errors and warnings, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.
- **Translation System Fixes**: Resolved critical namespace loading issues that were causing toast messages to display raw translation keys instead of translated text. Restructured translation keys for better organization and fixed all product-related toast messages.
- **Translation File Structure Optimization**: Implemented a categorized file structure for translations to improve maintainability and team collaboration.
- **Toast Message System Refactor**: Completely refactored the toast message system to eliminate hardcoded translations in the generic useCrud hook. Implemented a flexible messaging system where each component provides its own localized messages based on domain context. This ensures UserManager shows "User" messages, ProductAttributesManager shows "Attribute" messages, and InventoryLogs shows "Log" messages, all properly translated across English, Hindi, and Gujarati languages.
- **Button Color Scheme Fix**: Identified and resolved a critical theme configuration issue where custom Button variants were overriding Chakra UI's built-in colorScheme functionality. The custom `solid` variant in `src/theme/theme.ts` was hardcoding all buttons to use `brand.primary` (blue) background, completely bypassing `colorScheme="red"`, `colorScheme="green"`, etc. props. Removed the problematic custom variants while preserving the baseStyle for consistent button appearance (fontWeight, borderRadius, boxShadow, responsive padding).
- **Enhanced User Experience**: All buttons now display appropriate colors based on their action types: red for destructive actions (delete, archive, logout), green for positive actions (save, reactivate), blue for primary actions (login, add, update), and default gray for neutral actions (edit, cancel). This provides clear visual feedback that helps factory workers understand the impact of their actions.

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps**
The application is now in a stable and clean state with both a properly implemented localized toast message system and correct button color schemes. All critical bugs have been resolved, the codebase has been prepared for production, the toast messaging system provides contextually appropriate feedback in all supported languages, and the user interface now provides clear visual feedback through proper button coloring. The theme configuration has been optimized to allow Chakra UI's colorScheme functionality to work correctly while maintaining consistent styling. Future work will proceed based on the project roadmap.
