# FlowDash - Context

## üéØ **Current Work Focus**
The focus has shifted to enhancing the product management interface with improved UI components, better user experience, and robust error handling. The product table, filters, and editing modal have been significantly upgraded to provide a more intuitive and feature-rich experience for factory admins.

## üîÑ **Recent Changes**
- **Enhanced Product Table**: Added `Image` and `Color` columns to display product images and color information, improving visual representation of products.
- **Revamped Product Filters**: Converted simple text inputs to dynamic dropdowns for `Category`, `Design`, and `Color`, populated from the settings API for better user experience and data consistency.
- **Improved Product Editing Modal**: Updated the modal to use dropdowns for single-select attributes (`Category`, `Color`, `Design`) and checkbox groups for multi-select attributes (`Available Qualities`, `Available Packaging`). Replaced the image URL text input with a proper file upload component that integrates with the image upload API.
- **Fixed Translation Keys**: Added missing translation keys for dropdown placeholders and upload button in the product edit modal, and corrected the toast notification keys to ensure proper internationalization.
- **Added Robust Error Handling**: Implemented `AbortController` cleanup logic in `useEffect` hooks that fetch data to prevent potential race conditions and memory leaks, improving application stability.
- **Comprehensive Translation Audit Completed**: Conducted a thorough review and simplification of all translation files to ensure they are accessible to factory workers with limited technical literacy. Translations were simplified from technical jargon to everyday language, making the application more user-friendly for the target audience.

## üåç **Translation Audit Details**
A comprehensive translation audit was completed to ensure the application is accessible to factory workers with limited technical literacy. The audit covered:

### **Languages Supported**
- **English**: Base language with clear, simple terminology
- **Hindi**: Primary language for North Indian factory workers
- **Gujarati**: Regional language for Western Indian factory workers

### **Translation Files Structure**
- **`common.json`**: Shared translations for login, dashboard, navigation, and common UI elements
- **`product_manager.json`**: Product management interface translations
- **`products.json`**: Product creation and editing modal translations

### **Simplification Achievements**
- Replaced technical terms with everyday language (e.g., "Dashboard" ‚Üí "‡§°‡•à‡§∂‡§¨‡•ã‡§∞‡•ç‡§°"/"‡™°‡´á‡™∂‡™¨‡´ã‡™∞‡´ç‡™°")
- Simplified complex UI terminology for better comprehension
- Ensured consistent terminology across all languages
- Maintained cultural appropriateness for Indian factory context
- Verified all translation keys are properly implemented and functional

### **Coverage Areas**
- User authentication and registration
- Dashboard and navigation
- Product management (CRUD operations)
- Inventory logging and tracking
- User management
- Settings and profile management
- Bulk import/export functionality
- Error messages and notifications
- Form validation messages

## üöÄ **Next Steps**
The authentication and language-handling bugs have been resolved, the i18n refactoring is complete, and the product management interface has been significantly enhanced. The comprehensive translation audit has been completed with all translations simplified for factory workers. The system is now in a stable state with improved accessibility for the target user base. Future work will proceed based on the project roadmap.
