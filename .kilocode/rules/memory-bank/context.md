# FlowDash - Context

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current Work Focus**
The application has just undergone a critical stability fix related to a client-side race condition that occurred on page refresh for authenticated users. The focus was on resolving a series of cascading bugs, including an infinite API call loop, broken translations, and malformed navigation URLs.

## ðŸ”„ **Recent Changes**
- **Fixed Critical Race Condition**: Resolved a complex client-side race condition between Next.js App Router parameter hydration, `AuthContext` initialization, and `i18next` language loading. This fix stabilized the application on page refresh.
- **Eliminated Infinite API Loop**: By fixing the underlying i18n and authentication race condition, the infinite API call loop that was occurring on all authenticated pages has been eliminated.
- **Corrected URL Generation**: Fixed a bug where navigation links would be generated with `/undefined/...` in the URL path on page refresh. The fix ensures the language parameter (`lng`) is correctly passed from the page `params` to the layout components.
- **Stabilized Translations**: Ensured that translations load correctly and reliably on page refresh by synchronizing the `i18next` instance with the language parameter from the URL.
- **Centralized Loading State**: Refactored the initial application loading logic into the `AppInitializer` component to prevent multiple components from managing competing loading states, which was the original source of the "white blank screen" bug.
- **Enhanced Product Table**: Added `Image` and `Color` columns to display product images and color information, improving visual representation of products.
- **Revamped Product Filters**: Converted simple text inputs to dynamic dropdowns for `Category`, `Design`, and `Color`, populated from the settings API for better user experience and data consistency.
- **Improved Product Editing Modal**: Updated the modal to use dropdowns for single-select attributes and checkbox groups for multi-select attributes. Replaced the image URL text input with a proper file upload component.
- **Comprehensive Translation Audit Completed**: Conducted a thorough review and simplification of all translation files to ensure they are accessible to factory workers with limited technical literacy.

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps**
The application is now in a stable state. The critical authentication and language-handling bugs have been resolved, and the product management interface has been significantly enhanced. Future work will proceed based on the project roadmap.
