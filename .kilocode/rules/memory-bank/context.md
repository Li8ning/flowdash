# FlowDash - Context

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current Work Focus**
The focus has shifted to enhancing the product management interface with improved UI components, better user experience, and robust error handling. The product table, filters, and editing modal have been significantly upgraded to provide a more intuitive and feature-rich experience for factory admins.

## ðŸ”„ **Recent Changes**
- **Enhanced Product Table**: Added `Image` and `Color` columns to display product images and color information, improving visual representation of products.
- **Revamped Product Filters**: Converted simple text inputs to dynamic dropdowns for `Category`, `Design`, and `Color`, populated from the settings API for better user experience and data consistency.
- **Improved Product Editing Modal**: Updated the modal to use dropdowns for single-select attributes (`Category`, `Color`, `Design`) and checkbox groups for multi-select attributes (`Available Qualities`, `Available Packaging`). Replaced the image URL text input with a proper file upload component that integrates with the image upload API.
- **Fixed Translation Keys**: Added missing translation keys for dropdown placeholders and upload button in the product edit modal, and corrected the toast notification keys to ensure proper internationalization.
- **Added Robust Error Handling**: Implemented `AbortController` cleanup logic in `useEffect` hooks that fetch data to prevent potential race conditions and memory leaks, improving application stability.

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps**
The authentication and language-handling bugs have been resolved, the i18n refactoring is complete, and the product management interface has been significantly enhanced. The system is now in a stable state. Future work will proceed based on the project roadmap.
