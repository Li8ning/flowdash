# FlowDash - Context

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current Work Focus**
The application has just undergone a series of critical stability fixes, followed by a full codebase cleanup. The primary focus was on resolving a client-side race condition that caused numerous issues on page refresh for authenticated users.

## ðŸ”„ **Recent Changes**
- **Fixed Critical Race Condition**: Resolved a complex client-side race condition between Next.js App Router parameter hydration, `AuthContext` initialization, and `i18next` language loading. This fix stabilized the application on page refresh.
- **Eliminated Infinite API Loop**: By fixing the underlying i18n and authentication race condition, the infinite API call loop that was occurring on all authenticated pages has been eliminated.
- **Corrected URL Generation**: Fixed a bug where navigation links would be generated with `/undefined/...` in the URL path on page refresh. The fix ensures the language parameter (`lng`) is correctly passed from the page `params` to the layout components.
- **Stabilized Translations**: Ensured that translations load correctly and reliably on page refresh by synchronizing the `i18next` instance with the language parameter from the URL.
- **Centralized Loading State**: Refactored the initial application loading logic into the `AppInitializer` component to prevent multiple components from managing competing loading states, which was the original source of the "white blank screen" bug.
- **Added Loading Feedback**: Implemented loading state feedback on the login and logout buttons for a better user experience.
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed all debugging `console.log` statements from the codebase.
- **Linting**: Fixed all linting errors and warnings, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps**
The application is now in a stable and clean state. All critical bugs have been resolved, and the codebase has been prepared for production. Future work will proceed based on the project roadmap.
