# Comprehensive Security, Performance, and Code Quality Audit

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This audit of the FlowDash inventory management system has identified several critical and high-priority issues that require immediate attention. While the application is built on a modern technology stack, significant gaps exist in key areas that expose the business to security, operational, and legal risks.

**Key Findings:**

1.  **Critical Lack of Testing and Monitoring:** The most severe issue is the complete absence of an automated test suite and the lack of a production log aggregation service. This makes the application inherently unstable, difficult to debug, and highly vulnerable to regressions. Every new feature or bug fix is deployed without a safety net, risking operational disruption.

2.  **Significant Security Vulnerabilities:** The audit uncovered multiple security flaws. The use of an insecure JWT algorithm (HS256), multiple SQL injection vectors, and the lack of server-side session invalidation expose user accounts and the database to compromise. Furthermore, critical business logic flaws, such as the ability for an administrator to accidentally lock themselves out of the system, present a direct threat to business continuity.

3.  **Major Compliance Gaps:** The project currently has no privacy policy or any documentation related to compliance with data protection laws like GDPR. This represents a significant legal and financial risk to the business.

4.  **Inadequate Development Processes:** The CI/CD pipeline is missing essential quality gates, such as automated security scanning (SAST) and linting. The documentation is outdated and incomplete. These process-related issues lead to lower code quality, increased security risks, and slower development cycles.

**Recommendations:**

The highest-priority recommendations are to:
- **Implement a Comprehensive Testing Strategy:** Immediately begin writing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for critical application functionality.
- **Establish Production Logging:** Integrate a log management service to capture and analyze production logs.
- **Remediate Critical Security Flaws:** Prioritize fixing the identified security vulnerabilities, starting with the SQL injection vectors, the JWT implementation, and business logic issues.
- **Address Compliance Requirements:** Engage legal counsel to develop a privacy policy and ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations.

Addressing these core issues will provide a stable and secure foundation upon which to build future features and scale the application.

## 2. SECURITY AUDIT

### 2.1 Authentication & Authorization Analysis
- [x] JWT implementation security review (Reviewed)
- [x] Session management evaluation (Reviewed)
- [x] Role-based access control (factory_admin vs floor_staff) verification (Reviewed)
- [ ] Password security and hashing review
- [ ] Token expiration and refresh mechanism audit

**P1-Medium: Use of Symmetric JWT Algorithm (HS256) (Reviewed)**

- **Risk Level:** Medium
- **Location:**
    - [`src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts:43`](src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts:43)
    - [`src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts:56`](src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts:56)
- **Current Vulnerable Code:**
  ```typescript
  const token = await new SignJWT(payload)
    .setProtectedHeader({ alg: 'HS256' })
    .setExpirationTime(rememberMe ? '30d' : '1d')
    .sign(secret);
  ```
- **Secure Code Replacement:**
  ```typescript
  // 1. Generate RSA key pair:
  // openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private_key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
  // openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem

  // 2. Use environment variables for keys
  const privateKey = await importPKCS8(process.env.JWT_PRIVATE_KEY!, 'RS256');
  const publicKey = await importSPKI(process.env.JWT_PUBLIC_KEY!, 'RS256');

  // 3. Update signing and verification
  const token = await new SignJWT(payload)
    .setProtectedHeader({ alg: 'RS256' })
    .setExpirationTime(rememberMe ? '30d' : '1d')
    .sign(privateKey);

  // In withAuth.ts
  const { payload } = await jwtVerify(token, publicKey);
  ```
- **Business Impact:** Using a symmetric algorithm (`HS256`) requires sharing the same secret key between token creation and verification services. If this secret is compromised, attackers can forge valid tokens for any user. An asymmetric algorithm (`RS256`) uses a private key to sign and a public key to verify, enhancing security as the private key never needs to be shared.

**P0-Critical: Public Registration with Automatic Admin Privileges (Reviewed)**

- **Risk Level:** Critical
- **Location:** [`src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts:42`](src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts:42)
- **Current Vulnerable Code:**
  ```typescript
  const { rows: userResult } = await sql`
    INSERT INTO users (organization_id, name, username, password_hash, role, is_active)
    VALUES (${organization_id}, ${name}, ${username}, ${password_hash}, 'factory_admin', true)
    RETURNING id, name, username, role, is_active
  `;
  ```
- **Secure Code Replacement:**
  ```typescript
  // Option 1: Disable public registration entirely and create users via an admin interface.
  // Option 2: Default new users to a non-privileged role.
  const { rows: userResult } = await sql`
    INSERT INTO users (organization_id, name, username, password_hash, role, is_active)
    VALUES (${organization_id}, ${name}, ${username}, ${password_hash}, 'floor_staff', true) // Default to least privileged role
    RETURNING id, name, username, role, is_active
  `;
  ```
- **Business Impact:** This vulnerability allows any individual to create an account and immediately gain `factory_admin` privileges. An attacker could take control of the entire inventory system, manipulate product data, view sensitive operational information, and disrupt factory operations. This poses a direct and severe threat to business integrity and operational security.

**P2-Low: Lack of Server-Side Session Invalidation on Logout (Reviewed)**

- **Risk Level:** Low
- **Location:** [`src/app/api/auth/logout/route.ts`](src/app/api/auth/logout/route.ts) (No file provided, but inferred from application structure)
- **Current Vulnerable Code:**
  ```typescript
  // Likely implementation:
  import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

  export async function POST() {
    const response = NextResponse.json({ message: 'Logged out' });
    response.cookies.delete('token');
    return response;
  }
  ```
- **Secure Code Replacement:**
  ```typescript
  // Implement a token blocklist or denylist.
  // 1. Create a 'token_blocklist' table in the database.
  // 2. On logout, add the token's JTI (JWT ID) to this table.
  
  // In logout route:
  // ...
  const jti = payload.jti; // Assuming JTI is added to token payload
  await sql`INSERT INTO token_blocklist (jti, expiry) VALUES (${jti}, to_timestamp(${payload.exp}))`;
  // ...

  // In withAuth.ts:
  // ...
  const jti = payload.jti;
  const { rows } = await sql`SELECT 1 FROM token_blocklist WHERE jti = ${jti}`;
  if (rows.length > 0) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized: Token is invalidated' }, { status: 401 });
  }
  // ...
  ```
- **Business Impact:** Without server-side invalidation, a stolen JWT remains valid even after the user logs out. An attacker who obtains the token can continue to access the user's account until the token naturally expires. While the risk is lower because it requires token theft, it's a crucial security layer for sensitive applications.

**P1-High: User Enumeration via Verbose Error Messages (Reviewed)**

- **Risk Level:** High
- **Location:**
    - [`src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts:20`](src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts:20)
    - [`src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts:28`](src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts:28)
- **Current Vulnerable Code:**
  ```typescript
  // In login route:
  if (userResult.length === 0) {
    return NextResponse.json({ msg: 'Invalid credentials' }, { status: 401 }); // Same message for wrong user/pass is good, but register is different.
  }

  // In register route:
  if (existingUser.length > 0) {
    return NextResponse.json({ msg: 'Username is already taken.' }, { status: 400 });
  }
  ```
- **Secure Code Replacement:**
  ```typescript
  // In login route, the message is generic, which is good.
  // However, the combination of login and register responses allows enumeration.
  // The fix is to make responses generic across all auth endpoints.

  // In register route:
  if (existingUser.length > 0) {
    // Return a generic success-like message to prevent enumeration.
    // The user is not created, but the attacker cannot distinguish.
    return NextResponse.json({ msg: 'Registration request processed.' }, { status: 202 });
  }
  // Or, for both login and registration, use a generic error:
  return NextResponse.json({ msg: 'Authentication error' }, { status: 401 });
  ```
- **Business Impact:** User enumeration allows an attacker to build a list of valid usernames by probing the login and registration forms. This list can then be used for targeted attacks, such as password spraying, phishing campaigns, or social engineering. It significantly increases the attack surface and the likelihood of a successful account compromise.

### 2.2 API Security Assessment
- [x] Input validation on all `/api/*` endpoints (Reviewed)
- [x] SQL injection vulnerability scan (Reviewed)
- [ ] XSS protection verification
- [ ] CSRF token implementation check
- [ ] Rate limiting analysis
- [ ] CORS configuration review
- [ ] Request/response validation audit

**P0-Critical: SQL Injection in Dynamic `distinct` Endpoint (Reviewed)**

- **Risk Level:** Critical
- **Location:** [`src/app/api/distinct/[entity]/[field]/route.ts:106`](src/app/api/distinct/[entity]/[field]/route.ts:106)
- **Current Vulnerable Code:**
  ```typescript
  // The `tableName` and `columnName` variables are directly interpolated into the query.
  query = `
    SELECT DISTINCT "${columnName}"
    FROM ${tableName}
    WHERE organization_id = $1
      AND "${columnName}" IS NOT NULL
      AND CAST("${columnName}" AS TEXT) != ''
    ORDER BY "${columnName}"
  `;
  ```
- **Secure Code Replacement:**
  ```typescript
  // Use the `sql` template literal to safely handle identifiers.
  // The `sql.identifier` function is the correct way to handle dynamic table/column names.
  // NOTE: The 'pg' library used by @vercel/postgres does not support sql.identifier directly.
  // A library like 'slonik' or a more robust query builder would be better.
  // The immediate fix is to ensure the allowlist is extremely strict.
  // A better, but more involved fix, is to refactor to avoid dynamic identifiers.

  // Example with a hypothetical safe identifier function:
  const query = sql`
    SELECT DISTINCT ${sql.identifier(columnName)}
    FROM ${sql.identifier(tableName)}
    WHERE organization_id = ${organization_id}
      AND ${sql.identifier(columnName)} IS NOT NULL
      AND CAST(${sql.identifier(columnName)} AS TEXT) != ''
    ORDER BY ${sql.identifier(columnName)}
  `;
  ```
- **Business Impact:** A successful SQL injection attack on this endpoint could allow an attacker to bypass security measures and access, modify, or delete sensitive data from the entire database. This includes user credentials, product information, and inventory logs. The impact could range from data theft to complete system compromise, leading to significant financial and reputational damage.

**P1-High: SQL Injection via Unsafe Array Formatting (Reviewed)**

- **Risk Level:** High
- **Location:** [`src/app/api/products/[id]/route.ts:75`](src/app/api/products/[id]/route.ts:75)
- **Current Vulnerable Code:**
  ```typescript
  const { rows } = await sql`
    UPDATE products
    SET
      ...
      available_qualities = ${updatedData.available_qualities ? `{${updatedData.available_qualities.join(',')}}` : null},
      available_packaging_types = ${`{${finalPackagingTypes.join(',')}}`}
    WHERE id = ${id} AND organization_id = ${organization_id}
    RETURNING *
  `;
  ```
- **Secure Code Replacement:**
  ```typescript
  // Pass arrays directly to the SQL template literal.
  // The `sql` function from `@vercel/postgres` will correctly parameterize them.
  const { rows } = await sql`
    UPDATE products
    SET
      ...
      available_qualities = ${updatedData.available_qualities},
      available_packaging_types = ${finalPackagingTypes}
    WHERE id = ${id} AND organization_id = ${organization_id}
    RETURNING *
  `;
  ```
- **Business Impact:** Manually creating array strings for SQL queries is highly dangerous. An attacker could craft an input for `available_qualities` or `available_packaging_types` that breaks out of the string and executes arbitrary SQL commands. For example, an input like `{"'), (SELECT pg_sleep(10))-- "}` could be used to confirm the vulnerability. This could lead to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.

**P2-Medium: Inconsistent and Incomplete Input Validation (Reviewed)**

- **Risk Level:** Medium
- **Location:**
    - [`src/app/api/inventory/logs/route.ts:106`](src/app/api/inventory/logs/route.ts:106) (Manual validation)
    - [`src/app/api/users/[id]/password/route.ts:22`](src/app/api/users/[id]/password/route.ts:22) (Manual validation)
    - [`src/app/api/products/route.ts:91`](src/app/api/products/route.ts:91) (Good `zod` implementation)
- **Current Vulnerable Code:**
  ```typescript
  // Manual and incomplete validation in inventory logs POST
  const values = logsToCreate.map(log => {
    const { product_id, produced, quality, packaging_type } = log;
    if (!product_id || !Number.isInteger(produced) || produced < 1 || !quality || !packaging_type) {
      throw new Error('Invalid log entry data');
    }
    return [product_id, user_id, produced, quality, packaging_type];
  });
  ```
- **Secure Code Replacement:**
  ```typescript
  // Use a Zod schema for all input validation to ensure consistency and robustness.
  const logEntrySchema = z.object({
    product_id: z.number().int().positive(),
    produced: z.number().int().min(1),
    quality: z.string().min(1),
    packaging_type: z.string().min(1),
  });

  const logsSchema = z.array(logEntrySchema);

  // In the route handler:
  const validation = logsSchema.safeParse(logsToCreate);
  if (!validation.success) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Invalid input', issues: validation.error.issues }, { status: 400 });
  }
  // Proceed with validation.data
  ```
- **Business Impact:** Inconsistent validation can lead to security holes and data integrity issues. For example, the manual validation in the inventory logs endpoint might not cover all edge cases (e.g., empty strings for `quality`), potentially leading to corrupted data. A centralized validation library like `zod` ensures that all data entering the system through APIs is well-formed and expected, reducing the attack surface for injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.

### 2.2 API Security Assessment
- [ ] Input validation on all `/api/*` endpoints
- [ ] SQL injection vulnerability scan
- [ ] XSS protection verification
- [ ] CSRF token implementation check
- [ ] Rate limiting analysis
- [ ] CORS configuration review
- [ ] Request/response validation audit

### 2.3 Data Protection Review
- [x] Environment variables security (database credentials, JWT secrets)
- [x] Sensitive data exposure in logs or responses
- [ ] Database connection security
- [ ] Data encryption status (at rest and in transit)
- [ ] PII handling compliance

**P1-High: Sensitive Data Exposure in Error Logs and API Responses (Reviewed)**

- **Risk Level:** High
- **Location:**
    - [`src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts:61`](src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts:61)
    - [`src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts:78`](src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts:78)
    - [`src/app/api/users/[id]/password/route.ts:77`](src/app/api/users/[id]/password/route.ts:77)
- **Current Vulnerable Code:**
  ```typescript
  // In login route:
  catch (err: unknown) {
    const message = err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'An unknown error occurred';
    console.error('Login error:', message);
    return NextResponse.json({ msg: 'Server error', details: message }, { status: 500 });
  }

  // In password change route:
  catch (err) {
    logger.error({ err }, 'Failed to update password');
    const error = err as Error;
    return NextResponse.json({ error: error.message }, { status: 500 });
  }
  ```
- **Secure Code Replacement:**
  ```typescript
  // Sanitize error messages before logging or sending them in responses.
  // Never expose raw database or system errors to the client.

  // In login route:
  catch (err: unknown) {
    logger.error({ err }, 'Login error'); // Log the full error for debugging
    // Send a generic error message to the client
    return NextResponse.json({ msg: 'An internal server error occurred.' }, { status: 500 });
  }

  // In password change route:
  catch (err) {
    logger.error({ err }, 'Failed to update password');
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'An internal server error occurred.' }, { status: 500 });
  }
  ```
- **Business Impact:** Exposing detailed error messages can provide attackers with valuable information about the application's inner workings, such as database table names, column names, or file paths. This information can be used to craft more sophisticated attacks, such as SQL injection. It also gives a highly unprofessional appearance and can erode user trust.

## 3. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION ANALYSIS

### 3.1 Frontend Performance Audit
- [x] Bundle size analysis and recommendations
- [ ] Next.js optimization opportunities (SSR/SSG/ISR usage)
- [ ] Image optimization implementation
- [x] Code splitting and lazy loading review
- [ ] Lighthouse performance score analysis
- [ ] Core Web Vitals assessment

**P2-Medium: Large Libraries Impacting Initial Bundle Size (Reviewed)**

- **Risk Level:** Medium
- **Location:** [`package.json`](package.json)
- **Current Issue:** The application includes several large libraries in its main dependencies, which are likely bundled together, increasing the initial JavaScript payload sent to the client. This negatively impacts page load times, especially on slower networks.
  - `chart.js` / `recharts` / `react-chartjs-2`: Charting libraries are often large.
  - `exceljs`: Used for Excel export, not needed on initial page load.
  - `jspdf` / `jspdf-autotable`: Used for PDF export, not needed on initial page load.
  - `papaparse`: Used for CSV parsing, likely only for bulk import features.
- **Recommendation:**
  ```typescript
  // Use dynamic imports to load these libraries only when they are needed.
  // This is a key feature of Next.js for code splitting.

  // Example for a charting component:
  import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

  const WeeklyProductionChart = dynamic(() => import('@/components/WeeklyProductionChart'), {
    ssr: false, // This component will only be rendered on the client side
    loading: () => <p>Loading chart...</p>,
  });

  // Example for an export button:
  const handleExport = async () => {
    const { exportToExcel } = await import('@/lib/export'); // Assuming export logic is in a separate file
    exportToExcel(data);
  };
  ```
- **Business Impact:** A large initial bundle size leads to slower page load times, which can frustrate users and reduce productivity. For an internal factory application, this can mean wasted time for floor staff and administrators. Optimizing the bundle size will lead to a more responsive and efficient user experience.

**P3-Low: Overly Permissive Content Security Policy (CSP) (Reviewed)**

- **Risk Level:** Low
- **Location:** [`next.config.mjs:12`](next.config.mjs:12)
- **Current Issue:** The CSP includes `'unsafe-eval'` and `'unsafe-inline'`, which can open the door to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks and may also prevent browsers from applying certain performance optimizations.
  ```javascript
  value: "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' blob: data: *.public.blob.vercel-storage.com https:; font-src 'self';",
  ```
- **Recommendation:**
  - **Stricter CSP:** Remove `'unsafe-eval'` and `'unsafe-inline'` if possible. This often requires refactoring inline scripts and styles and ensuring that all third-party libraries are compatible with a stricter CSP.
  - **Use Nonces:** For inline scripts that are absolutely necessary, use a nonce-based approach to allow them securely. Next.js has documentation on how to implement this.
  - **Performance:** A stricter CSP can allow browsers to better optimize the rendering process.
- **Business Impact:** While the immediate risk is low, a permissive CSP is a defense-in-depth measure that has been weakened. A successful XSS attack could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or unauthorized actions on behalf of the user. From a performance perspective, modern browsers can better optimize pages with stricter CSPs.

### 3.2 Backend Performance Review
- [x] Database query optimization opportunities
- [ ] N+1 query problem identification
- [x] API response time analysis
- [ ] Caching strategy recommendations
- [ ] Connection pooling implementation

**P1-High: Inefficient Data Fetching with Separate Count Query (Reviewed)**

- **Risk Level:** High (Performance)
- **Location:** [`src/app/api/inventory/logs/route.ts:59`](src/app/api/inventory/logs/route.ts:59)
- **Current Issue:** The endpoint executes two separate queries to fetch a paginated list of inventory logs and the total count of those logs. This results in two round trips to the database for a single API request, which is inefficient, especially as the `inventory_logs` table grows.
  ```typescript
  const logsPromise = sql.query(logsQuery, [...params, limit, offset]);
  const countPromise = sql.query(countQuery, params);

  const [logsResult, countResult] = await Promise.all([logsPromise, countPromise]);
  ```
- **Recommendation:**
  ```typescript
  // Combine the data and count queries into a single query using a window function.
  // This is significantly more performant.
  const logsQuery = `
    SELECT
      l.id,
      l.product_id,
      p.name as product_name,
      p.color,
      p.design,
      p.image_url,
      u.name as username,
      l.produced,
      l.created_at,
      l.quality,
      l.packaging_type,
      COUNT(*) OVER() as total_count
    FROM inventory_logs l
    JOIN products p ON l.product_id = p.id
    JOIN users u ON l.user_id = u.id
    WHERE ${whereClause}
    ORDER BY l.created_at DESC
    LIMIT $${paramIndex++}
    OFFSET $${paramIndex++}
  `;

  const result = await sql.query(logsQuery, [...params, limit, offset]);
  
  const totalCount = result.rows.length > 0 ? parseInt(result.rows[0].total_count, 10) : 0;
  const data = result.rows.map(({ total_count, ...rest }) => rest); // Remove total_count from each row
  ```
- **Business Impact:** The current implementation will become progressively slower as the number of inventory logs increases. This will lead to a sluggish user experience on the inventory logs page, impacting the productivity of staff who need to review historical data. A more efficient query will ensure the application remains responsive and scalable.

**P2-Medium: Inefficient Bulk Insert Implementation (Reviewed)**

- **Risk Level:** Medium (Performance/Scalability)
- **Location:** [`src/app/api/inventory/logs/route.ts:115`](src/app/api/inventory/logs/route.ts:115)
- **Current Issue:** The bulk insert logic constructs a single large `INSERT` statement with a long list of `VALUES`. This can be inefficient for the database to parse and can hit statement size limits if the `logsToCreate` array is very large.
  ```typescript
  const valuePlaceholders = values.map((_, i) =>
    `($${i * 5 + 1}, $${i * 5 + 2}, $${i * 5 + 3}, $${i * 5 + 4}, $${i * 5 + 5})`
  ).join(',');

  const query = `
    INSERT INTO inventory_logs (product_id, user_id, produced, quality, packaging_type)
    VALUES ${valuePlaceholders}
    RETURNING *
  `;
  ```
- **Recommendation:**
  ```typescript
  // For large bulk inserts, it's often more efficient to use the `unnest` function
  // with an array of objects. This is a common pattern for high-performance bulk inserts in PostgreSQL.
  // Note: This requires the `pg` driver to be configured to handle this correctly.
  // The `@vercel/postgres` library might require a different approach, but the principle is the same.

  // Hypothetical example with a more advanced library like 'slonik':
  await connection.query(sql`
    INSERT INTO inventory_logs (product_id, user_id, produced, quality, packaging_type)
    SELECT * FROM ${sql.unnest(
      logsToCreate.map(log => [log.product_id, user_id, log.produced, log.quality, log.packaging_type]),
      ['int4', 'int4', 'int4', 'text', 'text']
    )}
  `);
  ```
- **Business Impact:** As the factory's production volume grows, the size of bulk log entries will likely increase. The current implementation may fail or become very slow when handling large batches of data. A more robust bulk insert strategy will ensure the system can handle high-throughput data entry without performance degradation or errors.

### 3.3 Database Performance Assessment
- [ ] Index usage analysis
- [ ] Query execution plan review
- [ ] Large dataset handling (pagination, filtering)
- [ ] Inventory-specific optimizations
- [ ] Real-time data sync performance

**P1-High: Missing Indexes on Foreign Keys and Frequently Queried Columns (Reviewed)**

- **Risk Level:** High (Performance)
- **Location:** [`schema_dump.sql`](schema_dump.sql)
- **Current Issue:** Several tables have foreign key columns and other columns that are frequently used in `WHERE` clauses, `JOIN` conditions, and `ORDER BY` clauses, but they are not indexed. This forces the database to perform full table scans for many common queries, which is highly inefficient and will lead to significant performance degradation as the data volume increases.
    - `inventory_logs`: Missing indexes on `product_id`, `user_id`, `created_at`, `quality`, and `packaging_type`.
    - `products`: Missing indexes on `organization_id`, `sku`, `name`, `is_archived`.
    - `users`: Missing index on `organization_id`.
    - `product_attributes`: Missing index on `organization_id`.
- **Recommendation:**
  ```sql
  -- Add indexes to the most frequently queried columns.
  -- This will dramatically improve the performance of lookups, joins, and sorting.

  -- For inventory_logs table
  CREATE INDEX idx_inventory_logs_product_id ON public.inventory_logs(product_id);
  CREATE INDEX idx_inventory_logs_user_id ON public.inventory_logs(user_id);
  CREATE INDEX idx_inventory_logs_created_at ON public.inventory_logs(created_at);
  CREATE INDEX idx_inventory_logs_quality ON public.inventory_logs(quality);
  CREATE INDEX idx_inventory_logs_packaging_type ON public.inventory_logs(packaging_type);

  -- For products table
  -- Note: A unique constraint already creates an index on (organization_id, sku)
  CREATE INDEX idx_products_organization_id ON public.products(organization_id);
  CREATE INDEX idx_products_name ON public.products(name);
  CREATE INDEX idx_products_is_archived ON public.products(is_archived);

  -- For users table
  -- Note: A unique constraint already creates an index on (organization_id, username)
  CREATE INDEX idx_users_organization_id ON public.users(organization_id);
  
  -- For product_attributes table
  CREATE INDEX idx_product_attributes_organization_id ON public.product_attributes(organization_id);
  ```
- **Business Impact:** The lack of proper indexing is a critical performance bottleneck. As the factory records more products and inventory logs, the application will become progressively slower. This will directly impact user productivity, making tasks like searching for products, viewing inventory history, and generating reports frustratingly slow. Implementing these indexes is essential for the long-term scalability and usability of the system.

**P3-Low: Use of Text Arrays for Relational Data (Reviewed)**

- **Risk Level:** Low (Design/Performance)
- **Location:** [`schema_dump.sql:249`](schema_dump.sql:249)
- **Current Issue:** The `products` table uses `text[]` columns (`available_qualities`, `available_packaging_types`) to store lists of attributes. This design violates database normalization principles (1NF) and makes querying for products with specific qualities or packaging types inefficient and complex. It also increases the risk of data inconsistency (e.g., "standard" vs. "Standard").
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE public.products (
      ...
      available_qualities text[],
      available_packaging_types text[],
      ...
  );
  ```
- **Recommendation:**
  ```sql
  -- Normalize the schema by creating join tables for these many-to-many relationships.
  -- This improves data integrity and query performance.

  -- 1. Create tables for the attributes themselves (if they don't exist)
  --    (Reusing product_attributes is a good option)

  -- 2. Create join tables
  CREATE TABLE product_to_quality (
    product_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES products(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    quality_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES product_attributes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    PRIMARY KEY (product_id, quality_id)
  );

  CREATE TABLE product_to_packaging_type (
    product_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES products(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    packaging_type_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES product_attributes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    PRIMARY KEY (product_id, packaging_type_id)
  );
  ```
- **Business Impact:** While not an immediate critical issue, this design choice creates technical debt. It makes it harder to build features that rely on filtering or reporting by product attributes. For example, answering "Which products are available in 'Premium' quality?" requires an inefficient array scan instead of a simple, fast join. Normalizing the schema will make the database more robust, scalable, and easier to maintain in the future.

## 4. CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT

- [ ] Strict mode compliance
- [ ] Generic usage appropriateness
- [ ] Type inference optimization

**P2-Medium: Inconsistent Error Handling in Catch Blocks (Reviewed)**

- **Risk Level:** Medium (Code Quality)
- **Location:**
    - [`src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts:58`](src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts:58)
    - [`src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts:72`](src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts:72)
    - [`src/app/api/users/[id]/password/route.ts:74`](src/app/api/users/[id]/password/route.ts:74)
    - [`src/app/api/inventory/logs/route.ts:89`](src/app/api/inventory/logs/route.ts:89)
- **Current Issue:** The error handling in `catch` blocks is inconsistent across the application.
    - The `login` route correctly uses `err instanceof Error` to safely check the error type.
    - The `register` route uses an unsafe type assertion: `const error = err as { code?: string; message?: string };`.
    - The `password` change route uses another unsafe assertion: `const error = err as Error;`.
    - The `inventory/logs` GET route just logs the raw error (`console.error(err)`).
    - The `inventory/logs` POST route checks the error message string, which is brittle.
- **Recommendation:**
  ```typescript
  // Standardize on a single, safe error handling pattern across all API routes.
  // A simple utility function can help enforce this.

  // In a new file, e.g., src/lib/error-utils.ts
  export function getErrorMessage(error: unknown): string {
    if (error instanceof Error) {
      // You might want to check for specific DB error codes here
      // const dbErrorCode = (error as any).code;
      // if (dbErrorCode === '23505') return 'A resource with that name already exists.';
      return error.message;
    }
    if (typeof error === 'string') {
      return error;
    }
    return 'An unknown error occurred.';
  }

  // In API routes:
  import { getErrorMessage } from '@/lib/error-utils';

  // ...
  catch (err: unknown) {
    logger.error({ err }, 'API Error'); // Log the original error object
    const message = getErrorMessage(err);
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Server Error', details: message }, { status: 500 });
  }
  ```
- **Business Impact:** Inconsistent error handling increases the complexity of the codebase, making it harder to debug and maintain. Unsafe type assertions can lead to unexpected runtime errors if a non-standard error (like a string or a plain object) is thrown. Standardizing error handling improves reliability and developer efficiency.

**P3-Low: Lack of Centralized and Reusable Type Definitions (Reviewed)**

- **Risk Level:** Low (Code Quality)
- **Location:** Multiple files, including:
    - [`src/lib/auth.ts`](src/lib/auth.ts) (AuthenticatedRequest)
    - API routes defining user response objects inline.
- **Current Issue:** The application lacks a centralized place for common type definitions. For example:
    - The `AuthenticatedRequest` in `withAuth` defines the `user` property, but the shape of this `user` object is not a shared, reusable type.
    - API routes that return user objects often define the structure of the response inline, leading to duplication and potential inconsistencies.
    - The payload for JWTs is defined inline wherever a token is created.
- **Recommendation:**
  ```typescript
  // Create a central file for shared type definitions, e.g., `src/types/index.ts`.

  // In src/types/index.ts
  export interface DecodedJwtPayload {
    id: number;
    username: string;
    role: 'factory_admin' | 'floor_staff';
    organization_id: number;
  }

  export interface UserApiResponse {
    id: number;
    username: string;
    name: string;
    role: 'factory_admin' | 'floor_staff';
    organization_id: number;
    is_active: boolean;
  }

  // In withAuth.ts
  import { DecodedJwtPayload } from '@/types';
  export interface AuthenticatedRequest extends Request {
    user: DecodedJwtPayload;
  }

  // In API routes
  import { UserApiResponse } from '@/types';
  // ...
  const userResponse: UserApiResponse = { ... };
  return NextResponse.json({ token, user: userResponse });
  ```
- **Business Impact:** Without centralized types, the codebase is more prone to errors and harder to refactor. If the shape of the user object changes, developers have to manually find and update every instance. Centralizing types with TypeScript improves developer productivity, reduces bugs, and makes the code self-documenting.

### 4.2 Architecture & Design Patterns
- [ ] Component structure and reusability
- [ ] State management pattern consistency
- [ ] API design and RESTful principles
- [ ] Error handling strategy evaluation
- [x] Folder structure and organization review

**P2-Medium: Flat Component Directory and "Fat Components" (Reviewed)**

- **Risk Level:** Medium (Maintainability/Scalability)
- **Location:** [`src/components/`](src/components/)
- **Current Issue:** The `src/components` directory has a flat structure, mixing large, page-level "manager" components (e.g., `ProductManager.tsx`, `UserManager.tsx`) with smaller, reusable UI elements (e.g., `ConfirmDeleteModal.tsx`, `DebouncedInput.tsx`). This leads to several problems:
    - **Poor Discoverability:** It's difficult to find related components or understand the hierarchy of the UI.
    - **"Fat Components":** The manager components tend to accumulate a large amount of state, data fetching logic, and event handlers, making them hard to test, debug, and reuse.
    - **Reduced Reusability:** Logic that could be extracted into custom hooks or smaller components remains tangled within these large components.
- **Recommendation:**
  ```
  // Refactor the component structure to be more modular and hierarchical.
  // 1. Group components by feature or page.
  // 2. Extract reusable logic into custom hooks.
  // 3. Break down large components into smaller, more focused ones.

  // Example of a better structure:
  src/
  |-- components/
  |   |-- ui/  (for generic, reusable UI elements like Button, Input, Modal)
  |   |-- common/ (for shared components like PageHeader, DataTable)
  |   |-- features/
  |       |-- products/
  |       |   |-- ProductList.tsx
  |       |   |-- ProductForm.tsx
  |       |   |-- useProductData.ts (custom hook)
  |       |-- users/
  |           |-- UserTable.tsx
  |           |-- UserEditModal.tsx
  ```
- **Business Impact:** A messy component architecture slows down development and increases the likelihood of bugs. Refactoring a "fat component" to add a new feature can be time-consuming and risky. A well-organized, modular architecture improves developer velocity, makes the codebase easier to understand for new team members, and enhances the overall stability of the application.

**P3-Low: Inconsistent API Logic Location (`lib/api.js`) (Reviewed)**

- **Risk Level:** Low (Code Quality/Consistency)
- **Location:** [`lib/api.js`](lib/api.js)
- **Current Issue:** The presence of a `lib/api.js` file introduces an architectural inconsistency. The project primarily uses Next.js API Routes (`src/app/api/.../route.ts`) for its backend logic. This JavaScript file deviates from that pattern and from the project's TypeScript-first approach. Its purpose is unclear without inspection, but it represents a different and undocumented way of handling API interactions.
- **Recommendation:**
  - **Analyze and Refactor:** Examine the contents of `lib/api.js`.
    - If it contains client-side data fetching logic, move it into a dedicated `src/lib/client-api.ts` or into custom hooks alongside the components that use it.
    - If it contains server-side logic, refactor it into the appropriate Next.js API Route (`/app/api/...`).
    - If it is dead or redundant code, remove it.
  - **Enforce Consistency:** All new API-related code should follow the established Next.js API Route pattern.
- **Business Impact:** Architectural inconsistencies, even small ones, create confusion for developers. They raise questions about which pattern to follow and can lead to duplicated logic. Maintaining a consistent, well-documented architecture reduces cognitive overhead for the development team, making the system easier to maintain and extend.

**P2-Medium: Duplicated and Inconsistent CRUD Logic in Manager Components (Reviewed)**

- **Risk Level:** Medium (Maintainability/Code Quality)
- **Location:**
    - [`src/components/ProductManager.tsx`](src/components/ProductManager.tsx)
    - [`src/components/UserManager.tsx`](src/components/UserManager.tsx)
- **Current Issue:** The `ProductManager` and `UserManager` components contain a significant amount of duplicated and slightly inconsistent logic for handling CRUD operations. Both components implement their own state management, data fetching, filtering, pagination, and modal handling for creating, editing, and deleting entities.
    - **Data Fetching:** Both use `useEffect` to fetch data but with different pagination and filtering implementations. `ProductManager` uses a "load more" style pagination, while `UserManager` fetches a complete, filtered list.
    - **State Management:** Both use multiple `useState` hooks to manage entities, loading states, editing states, and form inputs, leading to complex and hard-to-follow component logic.
    - **Error Handling:** Error handling is similar but not standardized. Both use `useToast` to display errors, but the structure of the toast messages and the way errors are extracted from Axios responses are not identical.
    - **Modals/Alerts:** Both components manage their own state for create/edit modals and delete/archive confirmation dialogs using `useDisclosure` and various state variables. This pattern is repeated almost identically in both files.
- **Recommendation:**
  ```typescript
  // Abstract the duplicated logic into a reusable generic hook.
  // This hook can manage the state and logic for any type of entity.

  // Example of a generic useCrud hook: src/hooks/useCrud.ts
  import { useState, useCallback } from 'react';
  import { useToast } from '@chakra-ui/react';
  import api from '../lib/api';
  import { getErrorMessage } from '../lib/error-utils'; // Assuming the error util from previous finding

  export function useCrud<T extends { id: number }>(entityName: string, endpoint: string) {
    const [items, setItems] = useState<T[]>([]);
    const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
    const toast = useToast();

    const fetchItems = useCallback(async (params = {}) => {
      setIsLoading(true);
      try {
        const { data } = await api.get(endpoint, { params });
        setItems(Array.isArray(data.data) ? data.data : data); // Adapt based on API response shape
      } catch (err) {
        toast({ title: `Error fetching ${entityName}`, description: getErrorMessage(err), status: 'error' });
      } finally {
        setIsLoading(false);
      }
    }, [endpoint, entityName, toast]);

    const createItem = async (newItem: Omit<T, 'id'>) => {
      // ... create logic
    };

    const updateItem = async (id: number, updatedItem: Partial<T>) => {
      // ... update logic
    };

    const deleteItem = async (id: number) => {
      // ... delete logic
    };

    return { items, isLoading, fetchItems, createItem, updateItem, deleteItem };
  }

  // In ProductManager.tsx or UserManager.tsx:
  // const { items: products, fetchItems: fetchProducts } = useCrud('products', '/products');
  ```
- **Business Impact:** Code duplication increases the maintenance burden and the risk of introducing bugs. A bug fixed in `ProductManager` might be forgotten in `UserManager`. Abstracting the common logic into a reusable hook would significantly reduce the amount of code, make the components simpler and easier to understand, and ensure that any future changes or bug fixes are applied consistently across all entity management views. This leads to faster development and a more reliable application.

## 5. BUSINESS LOGIC VALIDATION

### 5.1 Inventory Management Logic
- [ ] Product creation and update workflows
- [x] SKU duplication prevention

**P1-High: Race Condition in SKU Duplication Check (Reviewed)**

- **Risk Level:** High (Data Integrity)
- **Location:** [`src/app/api/products/route.ts:99`](src/app/api/products/route.ts:99)
- **Current Issue:** The API endpoint for creating a product attempts to prevent duplicate SKUs by first querying the database for an existing SKU and then inserting the new product if none is found. This check-and-insert logic is vulnerable to a race condition. If two concurrent requests are made with the same SKU, both `SELECT` queries could run before either `INSERT` query, find no duplicates, and then both would proceed to insert the product, resulting in duplicate SKUs for the same organization.
  ```typescript
  // 1. Check for existing product
  const { rows: existingProducts } = await client.query(
    `SELECT id FROM products WHERE sku = $1 AND organization_id = $2`,
    [sku, organization_id]
  );

  if (existingProducts.length > 0) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'A product with this SKU already exists.' }, { status: 409 });
  }

  // 2. Insert new product
  const { rows } = await client.query(
    `INSERT INTO products (...) VALUES (...)`,
    [...]
  );
  ```
- **Recommendation:**
  ```sql
  -- The most robust solution is to enforce this constraint at the database level.
  -- This eliminates the race condition entirely.
  -- The application should still handle the resulting database error gracefully.

  -- Add a unique constraint to the products table
  ALTER TABLE public.products
  ADD CONSTRAINT products_organization_id_sku_unique
  UNIQUE (organization_id, sku);
  ```
- **Business Impact:** Duplicate SKUs can cause serious problems in an inventory management system. It can lead to incorrect stock levels, confusion in order fulfillment, and inaccurate financial reporting. For example, if two products have the same SKU, scanning that SKU could bring up the wrong item, leading to shipping errors or incorrect inventory counts. Fixing these data integrity issues retroactively can be a difficult and manual process.
- [x] Inventory quantity validation (negative values prevention)

**P1-High: Lack of Centralized Inventory Tracking and Negative Quantity Prevention (Reviewed)**

- **Risk Level:** High (Data Integrity/Business Logic)
- **Location:** [`src/app/api/inventory/logs/route.ts:108`](src/app/api/inventory/logs/route.ts:108)
- **Current Issue:** The system currently logs production events but does not maintain a centralized, real-time inventory count for each product. The check `produced < 1` in the inventory logs endpoint prevents the logging of a single negative production event, but it does not protect against the overall inventory level for a product becoming negative. The system is missing a core concept: a dedicated `inventory` table that tracks the current quantity on hand for each product. Without this, it's impossible to validate transactions that would result in a negative stock count (e.g., returns, spoilage, or data entry errors).
- **Recommendation:**
  ```sql
  -- 1. Create a dedicated table to track inventory levels.
  CREATE TABLE public.inventory (
    product_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES public.products(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    quantity_on_hand INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    last_updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    CONSTRAINT quantity_must_be_non_negative CHECK (quantity_on_hand >= 0)
  );

  -- 2. When a product is created, initialize its inventory record.
  -- This can be done with a trigger or in the product creation API logic.
  INSERT INTO public.inventory (product_id, quantity_on_hand) VALUES (new_product_id, 0);

  -- 3. Update inventory atomically within a transaction when logging production.
  -- In the inventory logs POST endpoint:
  -- BEGIN;
  -- INSERT INTO inventory_logs (...);
  -- UPDATE inventory SET quantity_on_hand = quantity_on_hand + [produced_amount] WHERE product_id = [product_id];
  -- COMMIT;
  ```
- **Business Impact:** The inability to accurately track and enforce non-negative inventory levels is a critical flaw in an inventory management system. It can lead to selling products that are not in stock, inaccurate financial reporting, and a complete loss of trust in the system's data. For a factory, this could mean promising a client an order that cannot be fulfilled, leading to reputational damage and financial loss. Implementing a centralized inventory table with proper constraints is fundamental to the system's reliability.
- [ ] Quality control tracking accuracy
- [ ] Color and model variation handling
- [ ] Packaging data integrity

### 5.2 User Role Implementation
- [x] Permission boundary enforcement

**P0-Critical: Admin Can Revoke Their Own Admin Privileges (Reviewed)**

- **Risk Level:** Critical (Business Logic/Data Integrity)
- **Location:** [`src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts:13`](src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts:13)
- **Current Issue:** The `PATCH` endpoint for updating a user correctly checks if the requesting user is either the user being modified or a `factory_admin`. However, it does not prevent a `factory_admin` from changing their *own* role to `floor_staff`. If the last remaining admin in an organization accidentally or maliciously demotes themselves, there will be no one left with the authority to manage users, create new products, or perform other administrative tasks. This effectively soft-locks the organization's administrative functions.
  ```typescript
  // in src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts
  // This check allows an admin to edit anyone, including themselves.
  if (currentUserId !== userId && role !== 'factory_admin') {
    return NextResponse.json({ msg: 'You are not authorized to perform this action.' }, { status: 403 });
  }
  // There is no subsequent check to see if the 'role' field is being changed for the current user.
  ```
- **Recommendation:**
  ```typescript
  // Add a specific check to prevent an admin from changing their own role.
  // This logic should be added to the PATCH handler for updating users.

  const { role: newRole } = await req.json(); // Assuming role is part of the request body
  const userId = parseInt(context.params.id as string, 10);
  const { id: currentUserId, role: currentUserRole } = req.user;

  // ... existing checks ...

  // Add this new check:
  if (currentUserId === userId && currentUserRole === 'factory_admin' && newRole && newRole !== 'factory_admin') {
    // Before proceeding, check if there are other admins left in the organization.
    const { rowCount } = await sql`
      SELECT 1 FROM users
      WHERE organization_id = ${req.user.organization_id}
      AND role = 'factory_admin'
      AND id != ${currentUserId}
    `;
    if (rowCount === 0) {
      return NextResponse.json({ msg: 'Cannot demote the last administrator.' }, { status: 403 });
    }
  }
  
  // ... proceed with update ...
  ```
- **Business Impact:** This vulnerability could lead to a complete loss of administrative control over an organization's data within the application. If the last admin is demoted, the company would be unable to manage its own users or configure critical parts of the inventory system. Restoring access would require direct database intervention, leading to operational downtime and potential data integrity issues.

## 6. Infrastructure & Deployment Review

### 6.1. Vercel Platform

- [x] Environment variable security
- [ ] Build and deployment configuration
- [ ] Access controls and permissions

**P3-Low: Secure Handling of Environment Variables**

- **Risk Level:** Low (Informational)
- **Location:** [`src/lib/api.js:6`](src/lib/api.js:6), [`src/instrumentation.ts:5`](src/instrumentation.ts:5)
- **Current Issue:** N/A. This is a positive finding. The application correctly follows Next.js conventions for managing environment variables. Only variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are exposed to the client-side, and the ones in use (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`) are non-sensitive and intended for public exposure. This prevents the leakage of secret keys, database connection strings, and other sensitive data to the browser.
- **Recommendation:** Continue this practice. Ensure that no sensitive information is ever stored in an environment variable prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.
- **Business Impact:** Proper handling of environment variables is a foundational security practice. By adhering to this, the application significantly reduces its attack surface and protects critical infrastructure secrets from being compromised.

### 6.2. CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

- [ ] Code linting and formatting
- [ ] Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- [ ] Software Composition Analysis (SCA)

**P2-Medium: Inadequate CI/CD Security and Quality Gates (Reviewed)**

- **Risk Level:** Medium (Process/Security)
- **Location:** [` .github/workflows/ci.yml:1`]( .github/workflows/ci.yml:1)
- **Current Issue:** The current CI pipeline is overly simplistic and lacks essential steps for maintaining code quality and security. The workflow only installs dependencies, builds the project, and runs tests. It is missing the following critical stages:
    1.  **Linting:** The pipeline does not run a linter (like ESLint). This means code that does not conform to the project's style guide can be merged, leading to inconsistent, harder-to-maintain code.
    2.  **Static Analysis (SAST):** There is no automated security scanning of the application code. A SAST tool could automatically detect common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, insecure configurations, or hardcoded secrets before they are ever merged into the main branch.
    3.  **Dependency Scanning:** The pipeline does not check for known vulnerabilities in third-party `npm` packages. The project could be using libraries with critical, publicly disclosed vulnerabilities, creating a significant and unnecessary risk.
  ```yaml
  # in .github/workflows/ci.yml
  # The workflow is missing linting, SAST, and dependency scanning steps.
  steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3
  - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    uses: actions/setup-node@v3
    with:
      node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      cache: 'npm'
  - run: npm ci
  - run: npm run build --if-present
  - run: npm test
  ```
- **Recommendation:** Enhance the CI pipeline by adding the following jobs. These should be configured to run on every pull request to the `main` branch.
  - **Add a Linting Step:**
    ```yaml
    - name: Run ESLint
      run: npm run lint
    ```
  - **Integrate a SAST Scanner:** Use a tool like CodeQL to analyze the code for vulnerabilities.
    ```yaml
    - name: Initialize CodeQL
      uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
      with:
        languages: javascript
    - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
      uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
    ```
  - **Add Dependency Scanning:** Use a tool like `npm audit` or the GitHub Dependency Review action to check for vulnerable packages.
    ```yaml
    - name: Audit NPM dependencies
      run: npm audit --production --audit-level=high
    ```
- **Business Impact:** Without these automated checks, a burden of catching coding errors and security vulnerabilities falls entirely on human code reviewers. This is inefficient and highly error-prone. An inadequate CI pipeline increases the likelihood of security breaches, reduces code quality, and slows down the development process as issues are discovered late or, worse, in production.

## 7. Testing & Monitoring

### 7.1. Testing Strategy

- [ ] Unit test coverage
- [ ] Integration test coverage
- [ ] End-to-end (E2E) test coverage

**P0-Critical: Complete Absence of Automated Tests (Reviewed)**

- **Risk Level:** Critical (Process/Quality)
- **Location:** Entire codebase.
- **Current Issue:** The project has zero automated tests. A search for test files (`*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`, etc.) found no results, despite the project having `jest` and `@testing-library/react` installed as development dependencies. The `npm test` script exists but runs against an empty test suite. This complete lack of testing means there is no safety net to prevent regressions, verify the correctness of business logic, or ensure that components render as expected. Every change, no matter how small, carries a high risk of breaking existing functionality.
- **Recommendation:** Implement a comprehensive testing strategy immediately.
    1.  **Unit Tests:** Start by writing unit tests for critical business logic, utility functions, and individual React components. Focus on pure functions that are easy to isolate and test. Aim for high coverage on the most complex and critical parts of the application first.
        ```typescript
        // Example: /src/lib/utils.test.ts
        import { formatCurrency } from './utils';

        describe('formatCurrency', () => {
          it('should format a number into a USD string', () => {
            expect(formatCurrency(123.45)).toBe('$123.45');
          });
        });
        ```
    2.  **Integration Tests:** Write integration tests for API endpoints to verify that authentication, data validation, and database interactions work correctly together. Test the interactions between different components and hooks.
    3.  **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Introduce an E2E testing framework like Cypress or Playwright to simulate real user workflows from the browser. These tests are crucial for validating critical user journeys, such as user login, product creation, and inventory updates.
- **Business Impact:** A lack of automated testing leads to a highly unstable product. It dramatically increases the time and cost of development, as developers must perform extensive manual testing for every change. It also leads to a poor user experience, as bugs and regressions are frequently shipped to production. This unreliability can cause a loss of customer trust, operational inefficiencies, and direct financial loss if critical business logic (e.g., inventory counts, pricing) is incorrect.

### 7.2. Monitoring & Logging

- [ ] Production log aggregation
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Alerting strategy

**P1-High: Lack of Production Log Aggregation (Reviewed)**

- **Risk Level:** High (Operations/Security)
- **Location:** [`src/lib/logger.ts:13`](src/lib/logger.ts:13)
- **Current Issue:** The application uses `pino` for structured logging, which is a good practice. However, in the production environment, it is configured to log only to standard output (`pino.destination(1)`). While Vercel captures these logs, they are typically ephemeral and not stored in a way that allows for effective long-term storage, searching, or analysis. The project has Sentry for error *reporting*, but this does not cover informational logs, security audit trails, or debugging traces that are essential for observability.
  ```typescript
  // in src/lib/logger.ts
  const logger = pino(
    {
      level: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'info' : 'debug',
    },
    // In production, this just writes to stdout. The logs are not sent to a dedicated logging service.
    process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production' ? stream : pino.destination(1)
  );
  ```
- **Recommendation:**
  - **Integrate a Log Management Service:** Configure a log transport to send production logs from Pino to a dedicated log aggregation service. Popular choices that integrate well with Vercel include:
    - Logtail
    - Datadog
    - Axiom
  - **Implement the Transport:** This typically involves adding a transport configuration to the Pino setup.
    ```typescript
    // Example with a fictional log service transport
    import { createLogtailTransport } from '@logtail/pino';

    const transport = createLogtailTransport(process.env.LOGTAIL_SOURCE_TOKEN);

    const logger = pino(
      { level: 'info' },
      process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? transport : stream
    );
    ```
- **Business Impact:** Without centralized logging, troubleshooting production issues becomes incredibly difficult and time-consuming. It's nearly impossible to trace a specific user's activity, investigate a security incident, or understand the root cause of a performance bottleneck. This leads to longer downtimes, an inability to meet compliance requirements for audit trails, and a reactive, inefficient approach to operations.

## 8. Compliance & Documentation

### 8.1. Documentation Quality

- [ ] Accuracy and completeness
- [ ] Onboarding instructions
- [ ] API and schema documentation

**P2-Medium: Incomplete and Outdated Documentation (Reviewed)**

- **Risk Level:** Medium (Process/Maintainability)
- **Location:** [`DOCUMENTATION.md:1`](DOCUMENTATION.md:1), [`README.md:1`](README.md:1)
- **Current Issue:** While the project has a commendable amount of documentation, particularly in `DOCUMENTATION.md`, it suffers from being both outdated and incomplete.
    1.  **Outdated Authentication Flow:** The documentation describes a `httpOnly` cookie-based authentication mechanism, but the actual implementation uses JWTs stored in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`. This discrepancy is confusing and could lead developers to make incorrect assumptions about the security model.
    2.  **Manual Migrations:** The documentation mentions that database migrations are handled manually, which is a brittle and error-prone process. There is no clear guide on how to create or apply these migrations.
    3.  **Missing Operational Details:** The `README.md` and `DOCUMENTATION.md` files lack crucial operational details, such as a comprehensive guide to all environment variables, a disaster recovery plan, or instructions for common maintenance tasks.
- **Recommendation:**
  - **Update All Documentation:** Conduct a thorough review of all documentation and update it to reflect the current state of the codebase. Pay special attention to the authentication flow, database management, and environment variable setup.
  - **Automate Migrations:** Implement a proper database migration tool (e.g., `node-pg-migrate`) to automate schema changes. This makes the process repeatable, version-controlled, and less prone to human error.
  - **Create a Runbook:** Develop a simple operational runbook that details common procedures, such as backing up the database, restoring from a backup, and troubleshooting common production issues.
- **Business Impact:** Inaccurate and incomplete documentation significantly increases the onboarding time for new developers and makes maintenance more difficult and risky. It can lead to bugs, security vulnerabilities, and operational errors when developers or operators make decisions based on incorrect information.

### 8.2. Compliance

- [ ] Data privacy policy
- [ ] Adherence to regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

**P1-High: Lack of Compliance and Data Privacy Documentation (Reviewed)**

- **Risk Level:** High (Legal/Compliance)
- **Location:** N/A (missing from project)
- **Current Issue:** The project has no documentation regarding data privacy or compliance with regulations like GDPR, CCPA, or other relevant data protection laws. There is no privacy policy, no terms of service, and no information on how user data is collected, stored, used, or deleted.
- **Recommendation:**
  - **Consult with Legal Counsel:** The organization should immediately consult with a legal professional to determine which data privacy regulations apply to them based on their user base.
  - **Create a Privacy Policy:** Develop and publish a clear and comprehensive privacy policy that informs users what data is collected and how it is used.
  - **Implement Data Subject Rights:** Implement procedures to handle data subject requests, such as the right to access, rectify, or erase personal data (the "right to be forgotten"). This will likely require changes to the application's user management features.
- **Business Impact:** Non-compliance with data protection regulations can result in severe legal and financial consequences, including large fines, lawsuits, and reputational damage. It also erodes user trust, as customers are increasingly aware of and concerned about their data privacy rights.

**P1-High: Insecure Content Security Policy (CSP) Configuration (Reviewed)**

- **Risk Level:** High (Security)
- **Location:** [`next.config.mjs:12`](next.config.mjs:12)
- **Current Issue:** The Content Security Policy (CSP) is configured with insecure keywords that undermine its effectiveness.
    1.  **`'unsafe-inline'`:** The presence of `'unsafe-inline'` for both `script-src` and `style-src` allows the execution of inline `<script>` tags and inline styles (e.g., `style` attributes). This creates a significant vulnerability to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, as an attacker who can inject any HTML can also execute arbitrary JavaScript.
    2.  **`'unsafe-eval'`:** The use of `'unsafe-eval'` in `script-src` permits the use of `eval()` and related functions. This is a dangerous practice that can exacerbate XSS vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute code from string literals.
    3.  **Missing `frame-ancestors`:** The policy does not include the `frame-ancestors` directive. While the legacy `X-Frame-Options` header is present, the CSP `frame-ancestors` directive is the modern standard for preventing clickjacking and is more flexible. Without it, the application is more susceptible to being embedded in malicious iframes.
  ```javascript
  // in next.config.mjs
  {
    key: 'Content-Security-Policy',
    // 'unsafe-eval' and 'unsafe-inline' are dangerous
    value: "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' blob: data: *.public.blob.vercel-storage.com https:; font-src 'self';",
  },
  ```
- **Recommendation:**
  - **Remove `'unsafe-inline'`:** Refactor the frontend to remove all inline scripts and styles. For scripts, use external files. For styles, use CSS classes defined in stylesheets. If dynamic styles are absolutely necessary, use a nonce-based approach.
  - **Remove `'unsafe-eval'`:** Eliminate all uses of `eval()`, `new Function()`, `setTimeout` with string arguments, etc. Refactor the code to use safe alternatives like JSON parsing and first-class functions.
  - **Add `frame-ancestors`:** Bolster clickjacking protection by adding the `frame-ancestors 'self'` directive to the CSP.
  - **Example Stricter CSP:**
  ```
  // A much stricter and more secure policy
  "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self' blob: data: *.public.blob.vercel-storage.com; font-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'self';"
  ```
- **Business Impact:** An insecure CSP makes the application highly vulnerable to XSS attacks. A successful XSS attack could lead to session hijacking, theft of sensitive user data (including authentication tokens stored in cookies), unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user, and defacement of the application. This erodes user trust and can result in significant data breaches.
