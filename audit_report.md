# Authentication Flow Security Audit Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the findings of a security audit of the authentication flow. The audit was conducted to ensure compliance with the project's new security best practices. Several vulnerabilities were identified, ranging from high to medium severity. The most critical issues are the lack of CSRF protection and rate limiting, which expose the application to significant risks.

## 2. Findings and Recommendations

### 2.1. High Severity

#### 2.1.1. Missing CSRF Protection

*   **Finding:** The application does not implement CSRF protection. The `sameSite` attribute is not set on the session cookie, making the application vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. An attacker could trick a logged-in user into performing unintended actions.
*   **Recommendation:** Set the `sameSite` attribute on the session cookie to `Strict` or `Lax`. `Strict` is more secure but may affect user experience with cross-site navigation. `Lax` is a reasonable compromise.

    ```typescript
    // In src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts and src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts
    response.cookies.set('token', token, {
      httpOnly: true,
      secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
      maxAge: rememberMe ? 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 : 60 * 60 * 24,
      path: '/',
      sameSite: 'lax', // Add this line
    });
    ```

#### 2.1.2. No Rate Limiting

*   **Finding:** The login and registration endpoints lack rate limiting. This makes them vulnerable to brute-force attacks, allowing an attacker to make an unlimited number of attempts to guess passwords or create spam accounts.
*   **Recommendation:** Implement rate limiting on sensitive endpoints like login, registration, and password reset. A library like `rate-limiter-flexible` or a service like Upstash can be used. For example, limit login attempts to 5-10 per minute per IP address.

### 2.2. Medium Severity

#### 2.2.1. No Account Lockout Mechanism

*   **Finding:** There is no mechanism to lock an account after a certain number of failed login attempts. This increases the risk of a successful brute-force attack.
*   **Recommendation:** Implement an account lockout policy. For example, after 5 consecutive failed login attempts, lock the account for a period of time (e.g., 15 minutes) and notify the user.

#### 2.2.2. Long Session Duration without Refresh Mechanism

*   **Finding:** The "remember me" functionality sets a session duration of 30 days. While convenient, a long-lived token increases the risk of being compromised. The current implementation does not include a token refresh mechanism.
*   **Recommendation:** Implement a shorter-lived access token (e.g., 15-60 minutes) and a longer-lived refresh token. The refresh token can be used to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to log in again. This is a more secure approach to session management.

### 2.3. Low Severity / Informational

#### 2.3.1. Lack of Database Transactions

*   **Finding:** The registration process involves multiple database writes (creating an organization and a user). A comment in the code mentions that a transaction should be used, but it is not implemented. If one of the database operations fails, the data could be left in an inconsistent state.
*   **Recommendation:** Wrap the database operations in the registration route within a transaction to ensure data integrity.

## 3. Conclusion

The audit identified critical vulnerabilities that should be addressed immediately. Prioritizing the implementation of CSRF protection and rate limiting is crucial to securing the application. The other recommendations should also be implemented to further enhance the security of the authentication flow.
