# FlowDash - Inventory Management System

**Version: 0.6.3**

FlowDash is a web-based inventory management system designed specifically for small to medium-sized factories, particularly in the Indian market. It provides a simple, user-friendly platform for factory owners and floor staff to track production, manage inventory, and gain insights into their operations.

## Key Features

*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Three-tiered role system with `super_admin` (full control), `admin` (manages floor staff and products), and `floor_staff` (limited to their own logs).
*   **Product Management:** Create, update, and manage products with attributes like color, design, quality, and packaging types. Includes bulk CSV import and image upload capabilities.
*   **Media Library:** Centralized image management system with upload, view, edit, and delete capabilities. Features WordPress-style interface, bulk operations, drag-and-drop uploads, and automatic image optimization.
*   **Stock Management:** Comprehensive finished goods inventory tracking with separate rows for each product variant (quality + packaging combination). Features advanced filtering, pagination, and zero stock visibility toggle.
*   **Inventory Logging:** Floor staff can log production quantities with detailed tracking of who made changes and when.
*   **User Management:** Invite, edit, deactivate, and reactivate user accounts with strict role hierarchy enforcement.
*   **Multi-language Support:** Full internationalization support for English, Hindi, and Gujarati languages, optimized for factory workers with limited technical literacy.
*   **Data Export:** Export inventory logs to PDF and Excel formats with comprehensive filtering options.
*   **Dashboard Analytics:** Production summaries, weekly charts, and real-time inventory tracking.
*   **Mobile-First Design:** Responsive interface optimized for tablets and smartphones used by floor staff.
*   **Accessibility:** WCAG-compliant design with proper visual feedback through color-coded buttons (red for destructive actions, green for positive actions, blue for primary actions).

    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the following variables:

    ```
    POSTGRES_URL="your_vercel_postgres_connection_string"
    JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret_key"
    BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN="your_vercel_blob_token"
    SENTRY_DSN="your_sentry_dsn" (optional)
    ```

4.  **Run the database migrations:**
    Execute the SQL migration files in the `src/lib/migrations` directory against your Vercel Postgres database to set up the schema.

    npm run dev
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Recent Updates (v0.6.3)

### Bulk Import Image Optimization
- **Advanced Image Processing**: Implemented Sharp-based image optimization with automatic resizing (500x500px) and WebP conversion for 60-80% file size reduction
- **Hash-Based Duplicate Detection**: Added SHA-256 content hashing to prevent storage waste from identical images across bulk import, media library, and single uploads
- **Parallel Processing**: Implemented controlled parallel image processing (3 concurrent uploads) for 3x faster bulk imports on Vercel free plan
- **Smart Filename Handling**: Base filenames stored in database, Vercel Blob handles uniqueness with random suffixes
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: 30-second timeouts, graceful failure recovery, and detailed logging for robust operation
